# Cocktails and Drinks

Welcome to Cocktails and Drinks! This project is a web application that allows you to search and discover various cocktail recipes. Built with modern web technologies, it offers a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a fast and lean development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making REST API requests.
- **React Router Dom**: For routing and navigation within the application.
- **Headless UI**: Unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS.
